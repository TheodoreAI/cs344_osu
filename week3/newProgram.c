// Process API: Executing a new Progrm

/*

    The exec family of functions provides a number of functions that can be used to
    replace a running program with a new program we specify.

    Calling an exec function does not change the process ID of the calling process, but these functions replace the text, data, heap, 
    and stack segments of the currently running program.
